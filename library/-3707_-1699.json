        "Behold, the city of\nPrince George's\ngreatest attraction;\nMr. PG!\n\nMr. PG is the mascot\nfor Prince George,\nthe great city dubbed\nas 'the armpit of\nBritish Columbia'. The\ncity is also\nunofficially named BC's\n'northern capital' due\nto its location lying",
        "on the geographical\nmidpoint of the\nprovince.\n\nFun fact, the original\nMr. PG was built in\n1960 out of a cut up\nseptic tank!\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Another fun story\nthat not everyone in\nthe city knows about\nis 'the search for Mr.\nPG'.\n\nThere is a smaller\nstatue of Mr. PG that\nwas once on display.\nHowever, due to a\nmix-up, after the\ndisplay was taken\ndown he was never\nreturned to",
        "Prince George. The\npeople running the\ndisplay were very\nconfused why this\nstatue was in their\nposession, as he is a\nvery obscure icon. In\nan attempt to find the\nstatue's rightful\nowner, they sent Mr.\nPG on a world tour. He\njourneyed far\nacross the world,\n",
        "even all the way to\nJapan. With every\ncountry that Mr. PG\nvisited, a new feature\nto the statue was\nadded. The Japanese\ngave him a sash, many\ncountries gave him\nstickers, and the\nScottish gave him a kilt\nas well as a spigot\nwelded onto a\n*certain* location\nunderneath it.",
        "Eventually, Mr. PG\nmade his way to\nEngland where it\nhappened a tourist\nfrom Prince George\nwas visiting. Very\nconfused why a\nstatue of their\nhometown was in a\ndisplay here, Mr. PG\nwas eventually\nreturned home and is\nnow proudly on\n",
