        "Whales play a vital\nrole in the marine\necosystem where they\nhelp provide at least\nhalf of the oxygen\nyou breathe, combat\nclimate change, and\nsustain fish stocks.\nHow do they do it?  By\nproviding nutrients to\nphytoplankton.\n\n\n",
        "Drifting in the ocean's\nsunlight waters lives a\nmicroscopic forest of\ntiny plant-like\norganisms, called\nphytoplankton.  Like\nplants on land,\nphytoplankton need\nthe sun's energy,\nwater, carbon dioxide,\nand nutrients like iron\nand phosphate to\nphotosynthesis\n",
        " a process which\nprovides them with\nfood and the planet\nwith oxygen and a\nmeans to fight climate\nchange. As the base\nof the marine food\nweb, phytoplankton is\na key component in\nsustaining fish stocks\nand as they take in\nC02, phytoplankton\nsequester hundreds\nof",
        "carbon each year,\nhelping to fight climate\nchange.\n\nUnlike plants on land,\nphytoplankton cannot\nroot into the ocean\nbottom to retrieve the\nnutrients they need.\nWhere do they get it?\nResearch shows that\nwhales bring it to\nthem! Because whales\ncan't poop''",
        "under pressure, they\ntake their bathroom\nbreaks at the ocean's\nsurface and by doing\nso, supply\nphytoplankton with life\ngiving nutrients like\niron, nitrogen and\nphosphorus. Whales\nare the ocean's\ngardeners, tending\nthe forest of\nphytoplankton on\nwhich we all depend.",
        "And because whales\nmigrate, they\nre-distribute\nnutrients across\nlatitudes. This\nprocess is called the\n\"Whale Pump\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
