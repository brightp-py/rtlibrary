        "Tame Impala is a\npsychedelic\nalternative rock\nproject by Kevin\nParker, started in\n2007. He is most known\nfor \"The Less I Know\nThe Better\" from the\n2015 album, Currents.\nThis is a little build of\nthe cover of his\nlatest album, The Slow\nRush.\n",
        "While Tame Impala in\nthe studio is just\nKevin himself, there\nare other members\nwho help him out\nduring live shows and\nperformances.\n\nKevin has also done\nproduction work for\nThe Weeknd, Mark\nRonson, Travis Scott\nand a few others.\n",
        "Fun fact: Members of\nboth Tame Impala (live)\nand another\nAustrailian\npsychedelic rock\ngroup called Pond\nshare several\nmembers, as they are\nclose friends and\ncollaborators.\n\nI haven't heard Pond\nyet, but I'm sure I'll\nlove them.",
        "Tame Impala is one of\nmy current favourite\ngroups, as they're a\nlot of fun to drive to,\nlisten to, and just\nrelax to.\n\nMaybe check them out\nsometime! They're at\nleast worth a shot.\n\n-thenewfie15\n\n"
