        "October 26, 1597\nThe Battle of\nMyeongyang\nAdmiral Yi faced a\ncombined force of\nanywhere between 120\nto 330 Japanese\nwarships and supply\nships. All he had to\nwork with were the\nlast legs of the entire\nKorean navy: 13 ships.\n\n",
        "Admiral Yi studied the\ncurrents in the area,\ndiscovering that the\nwater in the\nMyeongyang Strait\nflowed northwards\nand southwards in\nroughly three hour\nintervals. He would\ntake advantage of this\nagainst the oncoming\nfleet.\n\n",
        "During the first phase\nof the battle, the\nJapanese navy rode\nthe current into the\nstrait. For a time, only\nthe flagship\ncommandeered by\nAdmiral Yi fought\nagainst hundreds of\nships while the rest\ncowered behind.\nEventually, they came\nto back him up.\n",
        "During the second\nphase, the tide shifted\nand the Japanese\nships began to collide\nagainst each other,\nand at that moment\nAdmiral Yi led the\ncharge forward,\nsinking 30 Japanese\nwarships and\nsuffering little to no\ncasualties.\n\n",
        "This would go down as\none of the most\nbrilliant naval battles\nin history, cementing\nAdmiral Yi's legacy as\na hero of Korean\nhistory.\n\ntl;dr\nAdmiral Yi was simply\nbuilt different.\n\n\n"
