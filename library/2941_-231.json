        "---Twin Heroines---\nThey teach it to me\nback in middle school,\nand its the best story\nI heard in history\nclass. Apparently in\nthe past there were 2\ntwin sisters named\nChan(translated to\nMoon) and\nMook(translated to\npearl) they were born\nin a respected family\n",
        "The girls' father was\nthe Governor of\nThalang(Tar-Lang,\none of the main three\ncity). Chan later\nmarried the man who\nbecomes the\nGorverner with her\npersuation and the\nhusband's connection\nwith the King's family.\nHe was later killed for\n\n",
        "disobeying the king's\nsummon to fight the\nBurmese armies that\nare attaking Thailand.\nHe was hoping that in\nthe atmosphere of\nchaos he would be\nable to get hold of all\nthe local lands.The\nwidowed Chan did not\nrun away from the\nBurmese invaders.The\nwidowed Chan didn't\nrun away from them.",
        "She decided to stay\nand protect the island\nand save the people\nof her motherland.\nTogether with the\nsister they came up\nwith a witty plan on\nhow to resist the\nnumerous army.The\ngirls gathered about\n1000 people and they\nall began to prepare\nfor the siege.\n",
        "They built a fortress\nin Thalang, raised\nearthworks and armed\nthe local men and\nwomen. Mook, Chan's\nsister, ordered to\nmake moulages of\nmuskets and cannons\nfrom palm branches\nand leaves to confuse\nthe enemy. The people\nworked days and\nnights to save their\nlives and family.",
        "Chan and Mook told\neveryone to wear\nmen's clothes and\nmade women cut their\nhair so that they\nwould look like\nmen-warriors. At night\nthey were patrolling\nthe fortress's\nperimeter and moved\naround all the time\nwhich created an\nillusion of a big army.\n",
        "During the day time\nwomen were placed in\nthe third and second\nrows, so that it would\nbe impossible to\ndistinguish them from\nmen. About 3000\nBurmese soldiers\nsurrounded the fort\nhoping for an easy\nvictory. But they\nrealized that it would\nbe difficult to take the\nfortress.",
        "The watchmen saw a\nbig army and\nnumerous cannons\nbehind the fortress\nwalls and the Burmese\ncommanders didn't\ndare to attack.  The\ninvaders were waiting\nwhich was a lucky\nsituation for Chan and\nMook who skilfully\nmanaged their fake\narmy.\n",
        "At night the men\npenetrated into the\nenemy's camp and\nkilled the Burmese\nsoldiers in the\ndark.The siege lasted\na little longer than\nthree months. The\nenemy troops grew\nthinner. During the\nsiege they undertook\nonly two attacks which\nwere unsuccessful.\n",
        "The hungry and\nexhausted Burmese\nsoldiers started to\nrevolt as they had\nunderstood that they\ncouldn't get the Thais\nout of the fortress.\n13 March 1786 the\nBurmese troops left\nThalang. The two\ngentle women could win\nin such unequal battle\nand save thousands\nof lives.",
        "King Taksin died\nduring the war and\nthe throne was taken\nby Rama the first who\ndid not remind Chan\nabout her late\nhusband's fault and\nrewarded the two\nwomen with honorable\ntitles for their\ncourage and valor\nwhen defending the\nisland from the enemy.\n",
        "The 13th of March\nbecame the Victory\nDay which is still\ncelebrated today\npompously.The\nmonument in the honor\nof the two sisters was\nbuilt. The monument\nsymbolizes the\ncourage and valor of\nfamous Chan and Mook\n- you can visit it in\nthe central street of\nPh"
