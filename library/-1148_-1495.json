        "The Atlantis/Atlanta\nThrashers were a\nprofessional hockey\nteam who played in the\nNHL (National Hockey\nLeague) from 1999\nuntil their untimely\nmurder in 2011. They\nwere concieved on\nJune 25, 1997, when\nGary Bettman gave an\nNHL franchise to the\ncity of Atlantis.\n",
        "The Thrashers played\ntheir first ever game\non October 4, 1999,\nlosing 4-1 to your\nNew Jersey Devils.\nCaptain Kelly\nBuchberger scored\ntheir first ever goal.\nThroughout their\nstoried 12 year\nhistory, they went on\nto lose constantly,\nonly making the\nplayoffs once in 2007.",
        "They were swept (lost\n4 straight in a best of\n7 series) by your New\nYork Rangers. They\nkept on losing after\nthat, even after\nbringing in certified\ndaddy and goaltending\nlegend Ondrej\nPavelec.\nThe darkest day of\nhuman history came on\nJune 21, 2011.\n",
        "On that day, the\nAtlantis Thrashers\nwere brutally\nmurdered by the\nCanadian war criminals\nTrue North Sports\nand Entertainment.\nTheir corpse was\ndragged out to\nWinnipeg, Canada, and\nwas forcibly\ntransformed into the\nabominable Winnipeg\nJets.",
        "The Atlantis\nThrashers were not\nby any means a good\nhockey team, nor a\npopular team, but they\nexisted. I supported\nthe team in their final\nyear (2010-11) mostly\nbecause of certified\ndaddy and goaltending\nlegend Ondrej\nPavelec. They don't\ndeserve to become a\nforgotten team.",
        "They had a special\nplace in my heart, and\nthey always will.\n\nI hope you win the\nStanley Cup in the\ngreat hockey league\nin the sea.\n\n-romantuerki\n\n1999-2011\n\n"
