        "Uluru (also known as\nAyers Rock is a large\nsandstone rock\nformation found in the\nsouth west part of\nthe Northern\nTerritory in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Uluru/Ayers Rock\nrises 1,142 feet (348\nmetres) above the\nsurrounding desert\nplain and reaches a\nheight 2,831 feet (863\nmetres) above sea\nlevel. The monolith is\noval in shape,\nmeasuring 2.2 miles\n(3.6 km) long by 1.5\nmiles (2.4 km) wide, with\na circumference of\n5.8 miles (9.4 km).",
        "The monolith is oval in\nshape, measuring 2.2\nmiles (3.6 km) long by\n1.5 miles (2.4 km) wide,\nwith a circumference\nof 5.8 miles (9.4 km).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "The rock and the\nsurrounding park\nwere named a UNESCO\nWorld Heritage site in\n1987, and UNESCO\ngave the park a\nsecond World Heritage\ndesignation in 1994\nfor its cultural\nsignificance.\n\n\n\n",
        "On 26 October 1985,\nthe Australian\ngovernment returned\nownership of Uluru to\nthe local\nPitjantjatjara people,\nwith one of the\nconditions being that\nthe Anangu would\nlease it back to the\nNational Parks and\nWildlife agency for 99\nyears  and that it\nwould be jointly",
        "managed. An\nagreement originally\nmade between the\ncommunity and Prime\nMinister Bob Hawke\nthat the climb to the\ntop by tourists would\nbe stopped was later\nbroken.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "The local Anangu do\nnot climb Uluru\nbecause of its great\nspiritual significance.\nThey request that\nvisitors do not climb\nthe rock, partly due\nto the path crossing a\nsacred traditional\nDreamtime track, and\nalso due to a sense\nof responsibility for\nthe safety of visitors\n",
        "Several controversial\nincidents on top of\nUluru in 2010,\nincluding a striptease,\ngolfing, and nudity, led\nto renewed calls for\nbanning the climb. On 1\nNovember 2017, the\nUluru-\u2219 \u2554  `juta\nNational Park board\nvoted unanimously to\nprohibit climbing Uluru.\n\n",
        "As a result, there was\na surge in climbers\nand visitors after the\nban was announced.\nThe ban took effect\non the 26 October\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "During a period\nbetween January and\nMarch, the Uluru get\nits rainy season. If its\na strong rainy\nseason, it causes the\nUluru to be covered\nin cascading\nwaterfalls and for\nmany breeds of\ndesert flowers to\nbloom around it in a\nvery rare and\nbeautiful sight."
