        "Sea Turtles facts\n\nGreen sea turtles are\nunique among sea\nturtles in that they\nare primarily\nherbivores, eating\nmostly seagrasses\nand algae. This diet is\nwhat gives their\ncartilage and fat a\ngreenish color which\nis where their name\ncomes from.",
        "Sea turtles lay their\neggs in a nest they\ndig in the sand with\ntheir rear flippers.\nThe group of eggs is\ncalled a clutch. They\nusually lay 100-125\neggs per nest and will\nnest multiple times\nabout two weeks\napart, over several\nmonths.\n\n",
        " As soon as the eggs\nhatch (roughly 2\nmonths later), the\nhatchlings dig out of\ntheir nest. This\nprocess generally\ntakes a few days.\nOnce they emerge, the\ntiny turtles hurry to\nthe sea and make\ntheir way offshore\ninto the open ocean\nonly One in 1000\nTurtles Make it to the",
        "Ocean.\n\nThe sex of sea\nturtles, like many\nother turtles, is\ndetermined by the\ntemperature in the\nnest. Cooler\nincubation\ntemperatures produce\nmale hatchlings and\nwarmer incubation\ntemperatures produce\nfemale hatchlings.",
        "Unlike other turtles,\nsea turtles cannot\nretract their flippers\nand head into their\nshells. Their\nstreamlined shells and\nlarge paddle-shaped\nflippers make them\nvery agile and\ngraceful swimmers. In\nthe water, their rear\nflippers are used as\nrudders, for steering.\n",
        "Some turtles nest in\nlarge groups, called\n\"arribadas,\" Spanish\nfor \"arrival.\" Only the\ntwo ridley turtles,\nKemp's ridley and the\nolive ridley, display\nthis arribada nesting\nbehavior.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "As reptiles, sea\nturtles breathe air,\nbut they have the\nability, under natural\nconditions, to remain\nsubmerged for hours\nat a time. They even\nsleep underwater.\nMost sea turtles\nspend their entire life\nat sea, only returning\nto nesting beaches to\nlay eggs.\n"
