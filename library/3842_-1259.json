        "Geographically,\nvolcanos tend to form\nalong subduction\nzones, zones where\nthe earth's tectonic\nplates collide. If not\nsubduction zones,\nvolcanoes like in\nHawaii and Iceland\nmost likely form\nthrough the mantle\nplume model, where\nlong strings of\nvolcanoes",

        "Historically, Paektu is\na vital component of\nKorean history. To the\nKoreans and the\nManchus of China, it is\na revered and sacred\nmountain.
