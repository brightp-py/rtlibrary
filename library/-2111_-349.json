        "Welcome to Casa de\nlas 100 Ventanas!\n(House of the 100\nWindows)\n\nThis building is in\nCoro, Venezuela, a\ncity on the southern\nend of the Paragana\nPeninsula, which would\nbe this spot on the\nMinecraft map.\n\nCoro is a UNESCO",
        "World Heritage site,\nmainly for its\nhistorical\narchitecture from\ncolonial times.\n\nWhile Venezuela was\npart of a Spanish\ncolony, this part was\na German colony in\nthe 1500s, and nearby\nislands were Dutch\ncolonies, leading to\nmany architectural",
        "influences in addition\nto the native people\nto the area.\nMany colorful\nbuildings remain to\nthis day, but they\nwere made of earthen\nmaterials susceptible\nto erosion. With climate\nchange heating up the\nworld as we\n(corporations really)\nadd way too much CO2\nto the atmosphere, we",
        "also allow the air to\nhave more water\nmoisture in it as well,\nsince hot air can hold\nexponentially more\nwater vapor as it gets\nwarmer.\n\nThis leads to even\nmore excessive\nrainfall in already\nrainy tropical areas\nlike much of\nVenezuela.",
        "Fortunately on New\nEarth though, we don't\nhave climate change\n(save for that part of\nAntarctica that got\nyeeted - RIP).\n\nThis building is one of\nthe colonial era\nbuildings in Coro, and\nit currently is the\nheadquarters of the\ncultural institute for\nthe state of Falcon",
        "(pronounced like\nFal-CONE, not the bird,\nmore like the Smash\nBros character).\n\nThe peninsula has\nseveral oil refineries,\nbut the city has tried\nto increase its tourism\nlately, as oil prices\ncan fluctuate\ndrastically, though\nclimate change makes\n",
        "it more difficult to\nmaintain these\nbuildings sadly, as can\npolitical instability I'd\nimagine.\nIDK what the interior\nlooks like, but I do\nknow that the exterior\nhas more windows than\nthis (as the name\nimplies); I just didn't\nwant to take up too\nmuch space so I made\nit smaller.",
        "Since it's a cultural\ninstitute and historical\nbuilding in real life,\nfeel free to add\nhistory and culture\nstuff if you'd like\n(keep it respectful).\n\nI've left the interior in\nits natural state both\nto show the shape of\nthe land it's on and to\nraise awareness\nabout the flooding.",
        "While it is technically a\npeninsula, the strip of\nland that connects it\nto the rest of the\ncontinent is so thin\nthat it doesn't show up\non this 8,000-block\nwidth scale, and it's\nsometimes called an\nisland.\n\nIt likely was an island\nuntil sometime in the\nlast 10,000 yrs or so.",
        "I will also note that\nthis is one of the\ndriest regions of\nVenezuela, getting\nabout 386 millimeters\nor 15 inches of rain\nper year on average,\nmostly in heavier\nstorms in a few\nmonths of the year.\n\nSo heavier rain from\nclimate change might\nnot be helpful for the",
        "water supply when a\nlot of that would just\nrun off anyway.\n\nThis area also has\nthe record for\nall-time high\ntemperature in the\ncountry, set on 29\nApril 2015: 43.6 deg C\n(110.5 deg F).\n\nAlthough tropical\nareas are generally",
        "hot or warm year\nround, deserts a bit\nfurther from the\nequator usually get\nhigher extremes, since\nthere isn't much\nmoisture to form\nclouds and block the\nsun, and sunlight\ncould go directly into\nheating the ground\n(and then air from\nthere) instead of\nevaporating water.",
        "This is why places like\nthe southwestern US,\nthe Middle East, and\nAustralia, which have\nvast deserts about 30\ndegrees from the\nequator have higher\ntemperature records\nthan places near the\nequator itself like\nSingapore and Quito\nthat stay humid all\nyear.\n",
        "Coro is the largest\ncity in Falcon, followed\nby Punto Fijo, which is\non the peninsula\nitself, more or less\nwhere this build is.\nTo get to where Coro\nwould be, take a few\nsteps back from this\nbook onto the shore,\nthen move eastward\nuntil across from the\nsoutheast corner.\nThanks for having this",
        "project RT and\neveryone - it's been a\nfun way to learn more\nabout the world :)\n\nI'm a climate scientist\nIRL, so it's also been\na fun way to educate\npeople too (I've made\nother builds about\nweather too) Thanks\nfor reading and have\na great day!\n-MusicalMet"
