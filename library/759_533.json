        "This place is known as\nthe quadripoint. One\nway to describe it\nwould be \"the only\npoint in the world\nlocated in four\ncountries at the same\ntime\".\nIt's located in the\nZambezi and Cuando\nRivers, in Namibia,\nZambia, Zimbabwe, and\nBotswana.\n",
        "While a quadripoint is\nin four countries, a\ntripoint is in three\ncountires, which is far\nmore common.\n\nHowever there is\ndebate as to whether\nor not this place is\nactually a quadripoint.\n\n\n\n",
        "It turns out it might\nactually be two\ntripoints that are\nvery close to each\nother. But I like to\nthink it's a quadripoint.\nIt makes it more\nspecial.\n\nAlso this building\ndoesn't exist in real\nlife.\n\n",
        "Please be nice about\nthe flags, I had\ntrouble making them.\n\nHope you like the\nquadripoint building!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
