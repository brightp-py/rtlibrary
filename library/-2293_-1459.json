        "What we have made\nfrom scratch is\nsomething that we\ntruly can be proud of.\nThe founding fathers\nof this community have\ntruly incredible in\ngetting the land we\nnow call the cottage\ncommunity. They\nfought hard and a lot\nof blood was shed. But\nalas they got what we\nnow call the cottage-",
        "-community. We can\nonly be proud of how\nfar we've come in the\nyears we've been\ntogether, so to the\nfounding fathers of\nour area, it is an\nhonor to be a part of\nthis truly amazing\ncommunity and an\neverlasting friendship\nwith those we share\nliving space with. We\nnever expected it to",
        "be as big as it is now,\nbut we surely are\nhappy with how it\nturned out. There will\nbe more history in this\nbook as we continue\nto evolve with the\ncommunity, but as we\nare now, we are\nperfectly okay as we\nare. But of course we\nwill have to evolve at\nsome point and we are\nlooking forward to do",
        "just that and with the\nyears to come we\nhope that more people\nwill come join the\ncottage community.\n\nFor now this is all\n\n- Cottage community\nleader - Tomstok\n\n\n\n"
