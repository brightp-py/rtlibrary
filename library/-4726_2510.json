        "The Longest Mission\n-----------------\nIn the original XCOM:\nUFO Defence, you can\nbe invaded by small\nsingle-scout UFO\nships.\n\nNormally, these UFO's\nare destroyed in one\nshot by practically\nany weapon, and thus\nyou never have to go\nand fight the scout.",
        "However, the longest\nmissions can be a\nnight-time\nAntarctic/Arctic\nScout-Hunt.\n\nMine in question was\nwith an Ethereal, a\nflying, mind-controlling\nalien that hid right\nbelow his landing\ncraft, mind controlling\nmy troops for 3\nhours straight.",
        "You kinda get a bit\nsick of old Strategy\ngames, but classics\nnever change - it's an\nevergreen game, like\nthe fascination of\nvisiting and building in\nother countries in a\nMinecraft server.\n\nHappy 8AM RT, from\nAustralia, as usual.\n\n"
