        "This is a very small\nregion within the\ngreater United Arab\nEmirates. Within it,\nthere is a small region\nencompassing the town\nof Madha and a small\nrange of mountains\nthat officially belongs\nto Oman. But within that\nsmall Omani region in\nthe UAE, there is an\neven smaller region\ncalled Nahwa that",
        "belongs to the UAE. So\nit is a tiny part of the\nUAE that is entirely\nsurrounded by Oman,\nwhich is also entirely\nsurrounded by the\nUAE. Just a funny\nthing to look at.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
