        "Elbow River Camp\n\nOne part of the\nCalgary Stampede is\nthe Elbow River Camp,\nformerly known as the\nIndian Village.\nStarted in 1912, and\nhosted in partnership\nwith the local First\nNations people, it is\ndesigned to educate\nand celebrate their\ntraditions and culture.",
        "Some history should\nbe provided. Calgary\nis located in the\ntraditional lands of\nthe Treaty 7 nations.\nThe Treaty 7 nations\nare the Kainai, the\nTsuut'ina, the Stoney\nNakoda, the Siksika\nand the Piikani.\n\nCanada bought\nRupert's Land off of\nthe Hudson's Bay",
        "Company in 1869, and\nbegan to settle this\nnewly bought land.\nThis land was the\nhome to dozens of\nFirst Nations groups,\nhere before the\nsettlers first arrived.\nAs Canada tried to\nsettle the west, they\noften came into\nconflict with these\ngroups.\n",
        "As such, Treaties\nwere made with\ndifferent groups of\ndifferent regions,\noften with unfair\nterms, where the\ngovernment made\nvarious deals.\n\nCalgary is located in\nthe Treaty 7 region,\nwhere the Bow and\nElbow Rivers meet.\n",
        "The original event\norganizers,\nrecognizing the unique\ncultures of these\ngroups (and likely\nwanting to profiter\noff of it) arranged\nfor them to show at\nthe event.\n\nOver time, it has\nbecome a staple of\nthe Calgary Stampede,\nand begun to strive",
        "in the nature of\nreconciliation to\npromote a positive\nrespect of these\ncultures.\n\n(Reconciliation is a\nprocess ongoing in\nCanada to make\nammends to First\nNations on the\nattrocities committed\nto them. Look up the\nResidential Schools",
        "because I am not able\nto fully describe what\nwas committed to these\npeople. It doesn't\nmean that everything\nis all good still, many\npeople still live in\npoverty due to the\nunfair treatments.\nResearch and educate\nyourself, and change\nwill happen.)\n\n",
        "These tipis are\nundecorated, as to\nrespect the culture\nof the FN groups.\nTipis carry symbolic\nand cultural\ndecorations, and it\nwould be\ninappropriate for me\nto decorate them.\n\n\n\n"
