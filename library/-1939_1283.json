        "This is the Valdes\nPeninsula, framed by\ntwo gulfs:\n\nGolfo San Jose, to the\nnorth\n\nAnd Golfo Nuevo,\nwhere you're standing\nnow.\n\n\n\n",
        "These gulfs are home\nto the world's largest\nbreeding grounds of\nSouthern Right Whales,\nwhich have white\ncalluses on their\nheads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Unlike other right\nwhales, southern right\nwhales seem to enjoy\nsomething called \"tail\nsailing,\" where they go\nsomewhat vertical and\nlift their tail out of\nthe water, drifting\naround by catching\nthe wind. It's a\nbehavior they share\nwith humpback whales,\nwho they regulary\ninteract with.",
        "It needs to be\nmentioned that\nsouthern right whales\nare currently\nendangered and\nprotected by\nArgentinian law. They\nare threatened by\nhuman fishing ships,\nbut also apparently\nby \"kelp gulls\"? Which\nis also our fault,\nbecause we fed the\ngulls a lot of trash."
