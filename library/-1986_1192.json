        "Hi, over the past few\nmonths i have picked\nup the totally normal\nhobby of finding\nstupid, insane, and\nabsolutely unginged\ncomic book\nSupervillains; I have\nnow compiled a few of\nmy favorites from\nMarvel and DC for you\nto look at and think\n\"What drugs were the\nwriters on?\" Enjoy!",
        "Snowflame (DC):\nSpeaking of drugs, the\nguy built here is\nSnowflame, the only\nredeeming thing about\nthe racist comic\nseries he originated\nfrom, he gets his\npowers of super\nstrength and immunity\nto pain by snorting\ncocaine. Yes, he's\nreal.\n",
        "The Big Wheel (Marvel):\nJackson Wheele was a\nrich asshole who\ncommissioned the\nTinkerer to build him a\ngiant weaponised\nwheel to get revenge\non the villain who\nblackmailed him with\nincriminating evidence.\n\n\n\n",
        "Kite Man (Hell Yeah):\nPopularized by the\nHarley Quinn TV show.\nI have not watched it,\nbut in the comics he\nuses weaponry\nattached to kites in\nhonor of his late son,\nwho he gave a kite as\na gift.\n\n\n\n",
        "Clock King and\nCalender Man (DC):\nYou'd think with those\nnames these two would\nhave control over\ntime or something, but\nno, they're regular\nguys who both have\nmotifs revolving\naround clocks and\ndates/times\nrespectively. Later on\nCalender Man was\nreimagined as a",
        "murderer not unlike\nthe Zodiac Killer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Paste-Pot-Pete\n(Marvel):\nA scientist who\ndeveloped a paste\nwhich he uses to\ncommit petty crimes,\nmost well known for\nbeing so pissed at\nSpider-Man laughing\nat his name he just\ngives up and stops\nfighting.\n\n",
        "Pre-Spider-Verse\nSpot:\nThough his first\nappearance in the 80s\nwas really enjoyable,\nfor the next few\ndecades, the writers\nat Marvel treated him\nas a puching bag to\nget brutally killed and\nrevived with no\nexplenation. Glad he\nnow has the respect\nhe deserves.",
        "Now, you might be\nwondering how\ncharacters like this\nget made, and the\nanswer would be time\nconstraints. Having to\nrelease dozens of\ndifferent comic series\nissues every month, a\nlot of times the\nwriters have to make\nup something dumb\nbecause there not\nenough time to flesh",
        "out a good or\ninteresting concept;\nBut while a lot of\ngarbage comes out of\nthis, a lot of iconic,\nbeloved characters\nstarted out like these\nguys, but snowballed\ninto something special.\nHope you enjoyed\nthis, and hopefully\ndidn't lose too many\nbrain cells. :)\n"
