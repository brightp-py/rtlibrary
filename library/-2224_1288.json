        "Hi everyone, Xissel\nhere. Still not a\nChilote myself but I\njust love this island\n(check out the dragon\nfight behind you, as\nwell as the ghost ship\nin front of you !)\n\nThis is the\nArchipelago of Chiloe\nand its main island (of\nthe same name)\n",
        "Chiloe is a part of\nChile, but has\ndeveloped its own\nculture and myths\nsuch as the Trauco, a\nvery horny gobelin\nwho can attract any\nwoman despite his\nugliness and kill with\none look (check out\nall of it, I can't do it\njustice with how little\ninfo I have myself)\n",
        "The island is prone to\nfloods, which is why\nmost houses are built\non stilts a few meters\nhigh, which is what I've\ntried to represent\nhere. The colourful\nwalls are inspired by\nthe very real town of\nCastro, the largest on\nthe island\n\n\n",
        "A little history : once\nclaimed by Hendrick\nBrouwer, a Dutch\nsailor who spent most\nof his life as a\ngovernor in the\nIndies, notably in\nJapan and Java, but\nwent to Chiloe to\nnegociate with the\nlocal Mapuche\nindigenous people in\n1643. He died the same\nyear on the island",
        "Later, during the\nXIXth century, Chiloe\nwas the last remaining\nterritory held by the\nspanish during the\nemancipation of Chile\n\nChiloe is known for its\nmany wooden\nchurches, some of\nwhich have been\nintegrated by UNESCO\n\n"
