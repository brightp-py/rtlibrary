        "The Great Earthworks\nof Benin, also known\nas the Walls of Benin,\nare a series of\nearthworks made up\nof banks and ditches,\ncalled Iya in the Edo\nlanguage, dug by the\nEdo people in the\narea around present-\nday Benin City, Nigeria.\nThey are the single\nlargest man-made\nstructure in history.",
        "Consisting of over\n16,000km (10,000 miles)\nof walls, they are 4\ntimes longer than the\nGreat Wall of China\nand consumed 100\ntimes more material\nthan the Great\nPyramid of Giza.\nEstimates for the\ninitial construction of\nthe walls range from\nthe first millenium CE\nto the mid-fifteenth",
        "century CE. It took\n700 years and an\nestimated 150 million\nhours of digging. The\nBenin Walls were\nravaged by the British\nin 1897 during what\nhas come to be called\nthe Punitive expedition.\nScattered pieces of\nthe structure remain\nin Edo, with the vast\nmajority of them being\nused by the locals",
        "for building purposes.\nWhat remains of the\nwall itself continues to\nbe torn down for real\nestate developments.\n\nWhat I've built is only\na small section of the\nwalls, showing the\ninner walls which are\nspeculated to have\nhad wooden\nreinforcements, the\nditches which had",
        "trees, thorny bushes,\nand other vegetation\nin it, to further impede\noncoming attacks, and\nthe outer walls.\nThe walls were\nanywhere from 7 to\n15 meters tall,\n(possibly even more)\nwhich I try to show in\nthis build by making a\nminiature of a village\ninside them.\n",
        "The walls also had\nwooden gates which\nwould've been under\nconstant guard watch,\nalso shown in the\nbuild.\n\nThank you for\nreading, and I hope I\ndid a good job in\ndescribing this.\n\n                -TheJzoli\n"
