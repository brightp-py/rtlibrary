        "Completed in 1966, the\nFrederick G. Gardiner\nExpressway provides\nservice between the\nintersection of\nHighway 427 in\nAlderwood to\nLakeshore Boulevard\nin east downtown\nToronto. Once an icon\nof Canadian modernity,\nthe expressway is now\na decaying scar of\n60s urbanisation.",
        "When it's not\ncompletely backed with\ntraffic, it provides a\ndirect and\npicturesque drive\nfrom downtown to\nPearson International\nairport. As early as\nthe late 90s, the\nfuture of the\ncrumbling structure\nhas been discussed\nby the city. Options\nhave been narrowed",
        "down to renovations\nor removal of\nportions or the\nentirety of the\nexpressway. The\nformer has happened\nbefore, notably when\nan expanse running\nalong Lakeshore Blvd\nwas reduced to its\npillars in 2001. Similar\nremnants can be\nfound along the\nremaining expressway.",
        "Despite its pedestrian\nand cyclist\nunfrliendliness and\nthe general ire it\ndraws from locals, it\nhasn't completely\ninhibited conviviality.\nMost space occupied\nby the elevated\nparkway is either\nasphalt, unpaved, or\nmore roads, but parks\nsuch as The Bentway\n",
        "can be found along its\nuderpasses. Downtown,\nspace south of the\nGardiner is rife with\ncondominiums and\nrevitalisation efforts\nto make the\nharbourfront more\nentertaining.\n\n\n\n\n"
