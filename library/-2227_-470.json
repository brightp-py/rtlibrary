        "In this Tour you will\nlearn the main and\nmost important events\nof Caribbean History.\n\nThe Categories are:\n\nPre-Colonial\nColonisation\nColonial Rule\nRevolutions\nDecolonisation\nand Modern Day\n",
        "Keep in mind that this\nis a stupid Minecraft\nserver that that I\ncouldn't include every\nsingle fact and event\nin this tour. This tour\nis just to educate you\non the basic\nCaribbean history.\n\nAt the end, please\nwrite reviews and\nthings I could add or\nchange. Thank you :)",
        "Very little is known\nabout how exactly the\nindigenous people of\nthe Caribbean lived.\n\nExperts say that the\nfirst island of the\ncaribbean to be\nsettled was Trinidad\nat around 9000-8000\nBCE. However this was\nbecause at that point\nit was still connected\nto South America.",
        "The first \"real\"\nislands were settled\nat around 3500 to\n3000 BCE. However,\nislands like the\ncayman islands were\nuninhabitat until\neuropeans arrived.\n\nThere are three\n\"ages\" to classify\nCaribbean prehistory:\nthe Lithic, Archaic and\nCeramic Age.",
        "There are/were 3\nmain culture/ethnic\ngroups in the\nCaribbean:\nThe Taino/Arawak\n\nThe Guanahatabey\n\nAnd the Kalingo and\nGalibi (the Kalingo are\nalso called the Carib\npeople from which the\nCaribbean region got\nit's name)",
        "It can be said that the\narrival of Europeans\nwasn't the best thing\nthat happened to the\nindigenous people of\nthe Caribbean. (It was\na real Y**T*** show)\nA prime example is the\nisland of Hispanola,\nwhere Christopher\nColumbus and his man\narrived to colonize\n(make profit from) the\nisland in 1493.",
        "Roughly 250.000\nIndigenous Arawak\npeople lived on the\nisland at that time.\nAfter 2 years of\nSpanish rule, over\nhalf of them were\ndead.\nAnd in 1550, only 500\nremained.\nThis happened due to\nforced (over)work,\nrebellions and most\ndamagingly: diseases.",
        "Over the next few\ndecades more and\nmore Europeans\ncolonized the\nCaribbean Islands.\nThe Colonisers were:\nThe Spanish, The\nPortugese, The Dutch,\nThe English, The\nFrench, The Danish,\nThe Swedish and at\none point even a\nLatvian Duchy tried to\ncolonise an island.",
        "As the indigenous\npeople of the\nCaribbean were dying,\nthe spanish brought in\nsome more...\n\"free labour\"\nfrom Africa.\nThis was also done by\npretty much every\nother country with\nterritory in the\nCaribbean and the new\nworld\n(excluding Greenland)",
        "The living standards\nof these people were\nbad. The death rate\non the plantations was\nhigh, a result of\noverwork, bad working\nconditions, diseases\nand brutality.\n\nOnce brought over,\ntheir average lifespan\nworking/serving on a\nplantation was about\nseven years.",
        "The Spanish also\nintroduced the so\ncalled \"Casta\" system\nwhich was a\nhierarchical\nrace-based ranking\nsystem of the\npopulation of the new\nworld.\n\nThe ranking went the\nfollowing:\n\n",
        "1: Nobles from Spain\n2: Nobles from colony\n3: Whites from Spain\n4: Whites from colony\n5: Mestizos: People of\nNative American and\nEuropean descent\n6: Mulattoes: European\nand African descent\n7: Free Native\nAmericans\n8: Free African people\n9: Freed Slaves\n10: Slaves",
        "The after effects of\nthis can be seen to\nthis day.\nFor example:\nEven though the\nisland of Dominica was\nunder Bri'ish rule for\nmany decades the\nmodern demographics\nof the island nation\nshow that around 75%\nof the population is\nAfrican\n(Afro-Dominicans)",
        "The age of\nrevolutions\n(a term I came up with\nbecause I needed a\ncool sounding name\nfor this piece of\nhistory) was a time\nwhen the people\n(especially the forced\nworking ones) living in\nthe Caribbean, to put\nit mildly, pretty much\nhad it with european\noverlordship.",
        "The first new world\nrevolt actually\nhappened in 1521,\nwhen Wolof workers\nfrom the Senegambien\ncoast revolted\nagainst the Spanish.\nBut the first\nsuccesful, and most\nfamous, revolution in\nthe Caribbean\nhappened in 1791 Haiti\nwhen they revolted\nagaint French rule.",
        "The rebelion lasted\nuntil 1804, and ended\nwith General Dessaline\ndeclaring Haiti as an\nindependent Republic.\n\nNext up was Cuba who\nin 1895 started the\n\"Cuban war for\nindependence\" against\nSpain. They were later\naided by the US when\nthe Spanish-American\nwar started.",
        "At the end of the War,\nin 1898, Cuba was\nsemi-independent.\nIt remained under US\noccupation for about\n4 more years until\nthey achieved full\nindependence. Puerto\nRico and the Philipines\non the other hand\nremained under US\noccupation with Puerto\nRico still being part of\nthe US to this day.",
        "Some other rebelions\nthat also occured\nduring this time period:\n\nJulien Fedon's\nRebellion in Grenada.\n(1795)\n\nTula's Rebellion in\nCuracao. (1795)\n\nAnd Bussa's Rebellion\nin Barbados (1816)\nare some examples.",
        "However, one of the\nmost notable, not war\nor conflict related,\nevents that happened\nduring this time was\nwhen in 1833 the\nBri'ish introduced the\n\"Emancipation Act\",\ncompletely ending\nslavery in all their\nholdings (excluding\nareas ruled by the\nEast India Company).\n",
        "Fun Fact:\nThe first country to\nfully abolish slavery\nin all territories was\nFrance in 1794.\nHowever, in 1802 they\nre-introduced\nslavery in sugarcane\ngrowing colonies.\n\nThe first American\ncountry to\npermanently abolish it\nwas Haiti in 1804.",
        "Decolonisation:\nThe decolonisation\nera is considered the\ntime after WW2 when\neuropean empires\nstarted (were\npressured) to grant\nidependence to all\ntheir territories who\nwanted it.\n\nThe list of caribbean\ncountries in order of\nindependence are:",
        "Jamaica: 1962\nTrinidad & Tobago:\n1962\nBarbados: 1966\nBahamas: 1973\nGrenada: 1974\nDominica: 1978\nSt. Lucia: 1979\nSt. Vincent and the\nGrenadines: 1979\nAntigua and\nBarbuda: 1981\nAnd lastly: St. Kitts\nand Nevis: 1983",
        "Fun fact: All the\ncaribbean countries\nthat got their\nindependence after\nww2 got it from the UK,\nthis was because the\nDutch and French\nislands decided to\nstay with them, while\nthe Spanish,\nPortugese, Danish and\nSwedish didn't had any\nislands anymore at\nthat time.",
        "The decolonisation\nera also happened\nduring the Cold War,\nwhich was why the UK\nonly allowed\nindependence for\nsubjects if they\nagreed to not form a\ncommunist government\nright after they got\ntheir freedom.\n\n\n",
        "However, the most\nknown event during\nthe decolonisation time\nwas the Cuban\nrevolution and\nsubsequent Cuban\nmissle crisis when the\nUSSR brought their\nnuclear warheads to\nthe island to intimidate\nthe US.\nThankfully that crisis\nwas averted. But not\nwithout a close call.",
        "Almost Nuclear War:\n\nOn 27 October 1962,\nduring the Cuban\nMissile Crisis, a group\nof US Navy vessels\nlocated a\nnuclear-armed Soviet\nsubmarine near Cuba.\nDespite being in\ninternational waters,\nthe US Navy started\ndropping signaling\ndepth charges,",
        "which were intended to\nforce the submarine\nto come to the\nsurface for\nidentification.\nBy then, there had\nbeen no contact to\nMoscow for a number\nof days. The\nsubmarine was too\ndeep to monitor any\nradio traffic, as it was\nbusy trying to hide\nfrom its US pursuers.",
        "Those on board did\nnot know whether war\nhad broken out or\nnot. The captain of\nthe submarine decided\nthat a war might\nalready have started\nand wanted to launch\na nuclear torpedo.\nSaid Soviet submarine\narmed with the\n\"Special Weapon\"\nrequired all three\nofficers on board",
        "to agree in order to\nauthorize the launch.\nAn argument broke\nout between the two\nofficers who wanted\nto launch the bomb\nand the third officer\n(Vasily Arkhipov) who\nwas the only one\nagainst the launch.\nArkhipov eventually\npersuaded the captain\nto surface and await\norders from Moscow.",
        "His succesful\npersuasion\neffectively averted a\nnuclear war which\nwould have likely\nensued if the nuclear\nweapon had been\nfired.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Today the Caribbean\nis a very popular\ntourist destination for\npeople around the\nworld with some 17,5m\npeople visiting the\narea in 2022. With the\nDominican REpublic\ngetting the most\ntourists with about\n6.4m tourist. The most\nvisited city was also in\nthe Dominican republic,\nPunta Cana with 2.7m.",
        "However the situation\nis also a bit\n\"complicated\" in some\nareas:\nHaiti-Dominican Border\n\nUS-Cuban relations\n\nThe US Embargo of\nCuba\n\nAnd the US-Haiti island\ndispute (though it's\nliterally just a rock)",
        "So all in all, the\nCaribbean is nice,\nbeautiful and safe.\n\n(If you ignore the\nhigh crime rates in\nsome parts, the lack\nof drinking water of\nsome islands, rising\nsea levels and\neverything I just\ntalked about on the\nprevious page that is.)\n",
