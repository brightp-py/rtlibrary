        "This is the personal\nlogs of Research\nTeam, Alpha 7 of\nGreenhorn Labs. We\nwere sent to\nAntarctica in order to\ncollect data on local\npopulations and\ngeological formations.\nThis is our story.\n\n\n\n",
        "Day 1: This is Dr.\nClayton Greenhorn,\nheir to Greenhorn\nlabs. I have brought\nDr. Miranda Simmons,\nan upcoming biologist\nthat specializes in\nbirds, Dr. Tyler\nMichaels, a geologist\nfor the past 20\nyears, and\nResearcher James\nOliver, our marine\nbiologist. The site is",
        "pretty much what can\nbe expected of\nAntarctica. Cold,\nsnowy, and bright as\nshit on account of the\nconstant sunshine. If\nthe snow didn't make\nthe light nearly\nblinding, I imagine the\nlandscape would be\nbeautiful. Michaels has\nbeen down here\nbefore. He told us to\nuse alarms since the",
        "sun never sets. I've\nelected to follow his\nadvice. You don't keep\na job for 20 years\nby not knowing what\nyour talking about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Day 2: According to\nSimmons, the penguins\nare displaying odd\nbehaviour. They're\nmore lethargic than\nusual, and have grown\nto unusual sizes. We\nmight be looking at\nrare mutations. This\ntrip could be\nGreenhorn's ticket to\nmajor acclaim.\n\n",
        "Day 4: The Penguins\nshit whole fish. We\ncouldn't believe it.\nSimmons saw one\nexcrete a fish, no\nsigns of digestion.\nJust dead. She took it\nin for observation.\nThey were hollow.\nBasically skin suits. No\nbones, no organs,\njust holes. Forget\nscience magazines and\ntextbooks, this could",
        "be world news!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Day 6: Oliver made an\nobservation. The\nplace we've set up\nshop is near\nsurgically flat.\nMichaels did some\ninvestigating and\ndiscovered the rocks\nhere seem to have be\nvanished to create a\nflat plane, and snow\nkind of covered the\nevidence. With any luck\nwe'll all be household",
        "names like Hawking or\nEinstein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Day 8: It's been over\na week and there\nhasn't been a single\ninch of snow. We know\nit snows, this\nresearch center is\nproof enough (We\ndidn't put that snow on\nthe roof). So where is\nit? That wasn't even\nthe weirdest\ndiscovery today.\nSimmons tripped and\nwhen she slid, she",
        "uncovered actual\nroad under the snow.\nA quick investigation\nfound this road went\nfor miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Day 13: With the\ndiscovery of road, we\ndecided to keep an\neye out for other\nstrange happenings.\nOn the horizon, we\nnoticed what we had\nthought were weird ice\nformations are\nactually buildings.\nOliver has a degree in\narchaeology, so he'll\nbe investigating.\n",
        "Day 20: It's been a\nhell of a week. We\ncan't contact anyone.\nHQ gave us a radio,\ncell tower, and\n[REDACTED] emergency\ncommunications. We get\nstatic on all of them.\nWe're alone out here,\njust in time for the\nworld to go crazy.\n\n\n",
        "Day 21: There is a\nsecond research\nstation from a\ncompany we've never\neven heard of. New\nLancashire\napparently. If we had\ninternet, I'd look them\nup, but we don't.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Day 22: The world has\nofficially gone crazy.\nWe saw legitimate\nmegafauna just\nroaming around, as if\ntheir very existence\nwasn't a biological\nimpossibility according\nconventional science.\nOliver joked we\nshould check to see if\nthey're hollow too.\nSimmons asked if he\nwas volunteering.",
        "Day 27: Apparently\nMythological\ncreatures exist in this\nloony bin. Go figure.\nAn actual Ningen from\nJapanese myths is\njust chilling next to\nour base. Because\nGod has a sick sense\nof humor.\n\n\n\n",
        "Day 29: Comms are\nback up. We had\ninitially surmised that\nwe were sharing some\nkind of mass hysteria,\nso we tested this when\nthe Radio started\nscreaming \"VON\nKARMA,\" and \"DRIFT\nKING!\"\n\n\n\n",
        "Day 32: We decided we\ncan't just ignore the\ngiant city, especially\nsince it's surrounded\nus. We felt that\nthrowing bodies at the\ncity before we knew\nthey wouldn't kill us\nwas a bad idea. Oliver\nis still our best bet.\n\n\n\n",
        "Day 35: There are no\ninhabitants. The\nbuildings seem to just\ngrow out of the\nground, but they are\nobviously man-made.\nOliver has pointed out\nthat the archetecture\ncomes from quite\nliterally all over the\nworld. What in the Hell\nis happening?\n\n",
        "Day 37: We have come\nto one conclusion.\nWhat we think of the\npast is obviously\nwrong. This around is\nis undoubtly real. As\nmen and women of\nscience, we must\naccept this. IT WAS I\nGREENHORN RESEARCH\nFACILITY! MANFRED VON\nKARMA!\n\n",
        "Day 50: VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,",
        "Forward: This is a\nstandard biology text\nbook. At least it was. I\ndon't know how this\nfreaky world we're in\nworks, but assuming\nthe creatures we\nknow still exist, this is\na basic summary.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Penguins: These\nflightless birds serve\nas an Antarctic\nStaple. Unlike most\nflightless birds, these\nguys don't rely on\nsize, but rather\nswimming ability to\nevade predators and\ncatch prey. The most\niconic was the\nEmperor Penguin,\nrecognizeable due to\nyellow markings on the",
        "side of their heads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Seals: These marine\nmammals hunt both fish\nand penguins. While\nthey do exist in other\nareas, the prominence\nof the Leapord Seal in\nthe Antarctic is\nprobably worth\nmentioning. Since our\narrival, I have yet to\nsee a single seal.\n\n\n",
        "Plants: None that we\ncan observe. If you\ngo underwater,\nthere's all sorts of\nwild and wonderful\nplants, but we didn't\nbring scuba gear, and\nyou couldn't pay me\nenough to take a dip\nin freezing water\nwithout the proper\ngear.\n\n",
        "Forward: I was\nprepared for\neverything except\nreality melting around\nme. My experience\nmeans nothing when\nthe world doesn't play\nby the rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Rock formations: Fat\nchance. I've dug\nthrough the snow,\nlooked on the beach,\nhell I even took a dip\nin the water. I couldn't\nfind anything close to\na natural rock.\nEverything I found\nwas obviously\nmanmade. The soil is\nfrozen, permafrost is\nhard to work around.\nThis memo is more me",
        "lamenting the hell\nwe've been brought to.\nAs well as my final\nsalient words to my\nfamily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Susan, I've loved you\nsince I met you back\nin 7th grade. I'm\neternally grateful\nthat you gave me that\none chance to wow\nyou, and I hope I kept\nsurprising you every\nday.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Mary, my beautiful\ndaughter, never\nforget we are\nmasters of our craft,\nwhatever field they\nmay be. I don't know if\nI was vocal enough\nwith my support, but I\nhope you make the\nmost of life as a\ndancer. You are\nalways my little girl.\n\n",
        "Little Ty, Although you\nare only a few years\nold, know that I will\nalways be proud of\nyou. Daddy is so\nsorry he won't be\nthere to see your\nremaining firsts. If-\nno when you read this,\nalways know I'm with\nyou, your mother, and\nyour sister. You're my\nlittle man.\n",
        "Forward: The voices in\nmy head scream for\nthe drift king. The\ndemon Von Karma\nhungers for revenge.\nI know no rest, for my\nsleep is on a bed of\nscreams. When I\nawake, the buzzing\nlowers, but my mind is\nno longer my own. May\nthe Drift King forgive\nme\n",
        "This was supposed to\nbe about trends in the\narchitecture of the\nmysterious city that\ngrew up around us.\nHowever, upon\nrealizing this world is\ninsane and The Drift\nKing is cruel, I\nthought better.\n\n\n\n",
        "VON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,\nVON KARMA, VON KARMA,",
        "The other me lies, this\nis the world as it\nalways was, and\nalways will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "The Shadow Legends\ncall for aid. They\nspread their message\nbut not through the\nDrift King. The visions\nburned into my skull\nfill me with dread and\nwith love. The Drift\nKing loves all his\nchildren, except me.\nEspecially me\n\n\n",
