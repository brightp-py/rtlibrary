        "British Columbia is\nhome to 1/3 of\nCanada's aboriginal\npopulation,\napproximately 200,000\npeople!\n\nThere are 198\ndifferent First Nations\nwithin British Columbia,\nwith over 30 different\nlanguages, with even\nmore dialects.\n",
        "Totem Poles originate\nfrom the Pacific\nNorthwest region.\nThey are carved from\nlarge trees, and have\nhistorically been\nerected by groups\nsuch as the Haida,\nTlingit, and Tsimshian\npeoples.\n\n\n\n",
        "The word 'totem' itself\ncomes from the\nAlgonquian word\n'odoodem', meaning\n'kinship group'. The\ncarvings represent\nancestors, cultural\nlegends, lineages, or\nevents. Their\nplacement and\nimportance lies within\nthe observer's\nknowledge of the\ncarvings.",
        "There are different\ntypes of totem poles:\n\n- House frontal pole\n- House post\n- Mortuary post\n- Memorial pole\n- Welcome pole\n- Shame/ridicule pole\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Perhaps the most\nintruiging one is the\nshame/ridicule pole.\nThese are created\nwith the intent of\nembarassing and\npublically shaming\ncertain individuals or\ngroups for their\nactions. These poles\nare often removed\nwhen the wrong is\ncorrected.\n",
        "An example of a shame\npole is the Seward\nPole in Saxman, Alaska.\nIt was created to\nshame former US\nSecretary of State\nWilliam H. Seward for\nfailing to reciprocate\ncourtesy and\ngenerosity following a\npotlach thrown in his\nhonour.\n\n"
