        "Hail can happen in\nmany regions across\nthe world.\n\nHow does hail form,\nand why am I building\nthis here?\n\nWhile the US gets the\nmost tornadoes of\nany country, and has\nhad many of the\nlargest hailstones,\nArgentina also gets",
        "some very large\nhailstones.\n\nTo form hail, you need\nquickly rising air in a\nthunderstorm. Say you\nhave a raindrop, and\nthen it rises above\nthe freezing level and\nfreezes.\n\nWhen that happens,\nother droplets it runs\ninto may freeze onto",
        "it.\n\nEventually it gets too\nheavy even for the\nvertical winds, and\nfalls after adding on\nall these layers from\nfreezing and thawing\nas it moves between\nwarm and cold air.\n\nArgentina and the US\nget some very large\n",
        "hailstones, and they\nboth have large plains\njust downstream of\nmassive mountain\nranges.\n\nWhen air flows over\nmountains, as it\ndescends it both\nwarms and spins more\non large scales. This\nallows for cyclones to\nform downstream of\n",
        "mountains, often\nbringing rough, windy\nweather downwind of\nthem.\n\nAs you get further\naway from the\nequator, the freezing\nlevel gets lower, so\nthere's a sweet spot\nwhere you have\nenough heat for\nrising motion, but are\nstill in a cool enough",
        "area to reach the\nfreezing level.\n\nAdditionally, moisture\nis needed for\nthunderstorms, and\nthe Gulf of Mexico\nprovides this in the\nGreat Plains of North\nAmerica, and the\nocean and the Amazon\ndo this for Argentina.\n\nTo get thunderstorms,",
        "you need instability (a\nquick decrease in\ntemp with height), a\nsource of lift (like a\nfront or a mountain),\nand moisture.\n\nFor *severe*\nthunderstorms, you\nalso need \"wind\nshear,\" or change in\nwind speed and\ndirection with height.\n",
        "Wind shear will often\ngovern what shapes\nthe storms take (lines,\nisolated cells, etc).\n\nUpper-level winds are\napproximately\nproportional to the\ntemperature gradient\nbelow them, so\nmidlatitude areas\ngenerally have more\nsevere storms, even\nthough tropical areas",
        "have more\nthunderstorms in\ngeneral.\n\nThe Great Plains of\nthe US and similar\nregions in Argentina\nmeet this quite well,\nmaking them have a lot\nof severe weather.\n\nOther mountainous\nareas around the\nworld have plenty",
        "of hail too, but fewer\ntornaodes.\n\nThanks for reading,\nand thanks for this\nproject :)\n\nI'm a climate scientist\nIRL, so happy to\neducate and build!\n\n-MusicalMet\n\n"
