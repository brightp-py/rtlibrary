        "Highway 407 in Ontario\nis the largest toll\nexpressway in the\nprovince, going from\nBurlington, ON to\nPickering, ON\n(privatized section)\nand from Pickering, ON\nto Clarington, ON.\n\nIt is fully electronic,\nmeaning there are no\ntoll booths. You just\ndrive on the highway.",
        "It's quite expensive,\nbut at least there's\nfrequent bus service\nbetween the City of\nMississauga and the\nCity of Markham.\n\nThere's also plenty of\nparking at many ramps\nfor carpooling and\nbuses.\n\nTraffic on the highway\nnever seems to jam.",
        "Some parts of the\nhighway are\nprivatized, while the\nother part is owned\nby the province of\nOntario.\n\nI use the highway's\nbus services to\ntravel between cities.\nI wouldn't drive on it\nthough.\n-fastattacker17\n"
