        "Whale Facts\n\nMale humpback whales\nfound in U.S. waters\nsing complex songs in\nwinter breeding areas\nin waters near Hawaii,\nin the Caribbean, and\nelsewhere that can\nlast up to 20 minutes\nand be heard miles\naway.\n\n",
        "The blue whale is the\nlargest animal that\never lived and can\ngrow to 90 or more\nfeet and weigh as\nmuch as 24 elephants!\nThat's more than\n330,000 pounds\n(150,000 kg).\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Some species of\nwhales are among the\nlongest lived mammals.\nScientists estimate\nbowhead whales (a\nbaleen whale found in\nthe Arctic) can live\nfor more than 200\nyears\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Killer whales are\nhighly social and\noften travel in groups\nthat are matrifocal-a\nfamily unit focused or\ncentered on the\nmother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Beluga whales have\nflexible necks, allowing\nthem to move their\nheads. Their complex\ncommunication\nrepertoire of whistles,\nclicks, and chirps has\nprompted the nickname\ncanaries of the sea\"\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Gray whales make one\nof the longest annual\nmigrations of any\nmammal: they travel\nabout 10,000 miles\n(16,000 km) round trip!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "North Atlantic right\nwhales gather small\norganisms near the\nwater surface,\nstraining seawater\nwith their long baleen\nplates. The whales'\nsurface feeding\nbehavior and\nbuoyancy make them\nvulnerable to\ncollisions.\n\n",
        "Sperm whales were\nalmost driven to\nextinction by\ncommercial whalers\nwho sought the\nwhales' blubber and\nthe unique oil derived\nfrom the spermaceti\norgan'' found in their\nmassive heads. The\nspermaceti organ is a\nkey part of their\necholocation system.\n",
        "In 2014, a Cuvier's\nbeaked whale made the\ndeepest and longest\ndive ever recorded\nfor a cetacean when\nit reached a depth of\n1.9 miles (2,992 m) and\nstayed submerged for\nmore than 2 hours.\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Blue whales are not\nactually blue. Instead,\nblue whales gain their\ncolorful names from\nthe beautiful blue\ncolor of the water\nthat is seen all\naround them as these\ngentle giants rise to\nthe surface for a\nbreath of fresh air.\n\n\n",
        "All Dolphins are infact\nWhales, All Dolphins\nand Whales are\nmembers of the\nCetacea infraorder.\nthe infraorder is\nmade up of two\nsuborders baleen\nwhales and toothed\nwhales. Baleen whales\ninclude the really big\nones, such as blue\nwhales and humpbacks.\n",
        "Toothed whales\ninclude dolphins and\norcas, or killer\nwhales, as they're\noften known.\nIn fact, orcas are the\nlargest dolphins,\ngrowing to be about\n32 feet (10 meters)\nlong.\n\n\n\n",
        "Some whales like the\nSperm whale can hold\ntheir breath\nunderwater, sometimes\nfor up to 90 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "the sperm whale's\nbrain weighs about\nfive times as much as\na human brain. The\nextent of their highly\nspecialized\nintelligence remains\npartially a mystery\ndue to a lack of our\nunderstanding of\nthese amazing animals\nbecause of their\nelusive surface\nbehaviors.",
        "Unlike toothed whales\nwho communicate\nthrough a series of\nunique clicks and\nwhistles, baleen\nwhales communicate\nthrough the use of\nmoans, grunts, and\ngroans. The lower\nfrequency sounds\nallow their calls to\ntravel longer\ndistances with far\nless distortion.",
        "Sperm whales also\nhave the loudest\nsound on earth  these\nwhales are louder\nthan a jet plane\nengine taking off in\nflight. Reaching 230\ndB, the communicative\nnature of the sperm\nwhale can physically\nblow out a human's\neardrums and can\neven vibrate the\nhuman body to death.",
        "while most whales and\ndolphins have between\n3-4 stomachs, the\nlargest member of the\nbeaked whale family is\nthe Berardius bairdii,\nor more commonly\ncalled Baird's whale,\nBaird's whale has a\ntotal of 13 stomachs.\n\n\n\n",
        "Rorqual whales make\nup some of the\nlargest animals on our\nplanet, but their main\nmeal source is\nderived from one of\nthe smallest\ncreatures on the\nplanet called krill\nRorqual whales have\nthe presence of\nbaleen, a keratin-like\nset of plates that line\ntheir mouths in lieu"
