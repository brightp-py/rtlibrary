        "CUBE is a 1997\nCanadian\npsychological sci-fi\nhorror film. At least 7\nprisoners are put into\nthis maze of CUBES\n(fun fact: all are\nnamed after prisons\nwhich reflect their\ncharacter), where\nseveral rooms are\nbooby-trapped with\nspikes, lazers, acid,\nand a whole lot more.",
        "The film is fantastic,\nfrom what I've heard,\nand it really plays on\nthe human psyche and\nhow, when people are\nput into a nightmare\nsituation, they can be\ndriven to absolute\nmadess. Yipes. The film\nhas both a sequel and\na prequel, and I highly\nrecommend it.\n\n",
