        "Honeypot Ants are a\nkind of ant that have\na special caste known\nas \"Repletes\". They\ngorge themselves with\nfood (mostly nectar)\nwhich makes their\nabdomens grow huge\nThey then hang off of\nthe ceilings of their\nnests, acting like living\nrefrigerators for\ntheir sisters to feed\nfrom!",
        "Ants share food\nbetween each other\nthrough a process\ncalled \"Trophallaxis\",\nand it's a lot like the\nKirby games! All ants\nhave a special\nstomach that they use\nto store food that\nthey can then share\nwith their sisters\nlater. Repletes are\nreserved for when\nfood gets scarce!",
        "Honeypot Repletes\nare eaten as little\nsnacks in Mexico and\nother countries\naround the world\n(mainly Australia), as\ntheir nectar-filled\nabdomens are very\nsweet. While I wouldn't\nsuggest eating them,\nHoneypot Ants are a\nvery unique type of\nant, and fascinating\ncreatures!"
