        "The Owl House is a\nshow that was made\nfor The Disney\nChannel by Dana\nTerrace\n\n\nFocusing on a nerdy\nhuman named Luz as\nshe discovers a new\nworld of magic and\ndangers\n\n",
        "She finds a witch\nnamed Edalyn\nClawthorne, and along\nwith the King of\nDemons (very cute)\nand Hooty (a house\ndemon that is an owl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "((both King and Hooty\nare voiced by Alex\nHirsh and I love them\nalso Hooty's voice was\ninitially a joke until\nDana Terrace heard it\nand fell in love))\n\nThe show first aired\non January 10, 2020\nand its final episode\naired on April 8, 2023\n\n",
        "The show was initially\nsuppposed to have\nmany more episodes\nbut the show was\ncanceled during the\nmiddle of season 2 in\n2021, with it having 7\nmonths between\nepisode 10 and 11 of\nthe 2nd season\n\n\n\n",
        "Many fans theorized\nthis was because Luz\nand another\ncharacter, Amity\nBlight, had entered\ninto a homosexual\nrelationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Dana announced that\nit was not the sited\nreason for the\ncancellation, as a\nDisney Executive said\nit was because the\nshow \"didnt fit the\n(Disney) brand\"\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Despite this, the show\ndid eventually\ncontinue and the 2nd\nseason ended as\nplanned, having 21\nepisodes. The third\nseason however\nrecieved the Disney\nshow treatment and\nthe team of The Owl\nHouse were given 3 44\nminute episodes to\nfinish off the series\n",
        "As a fun side note\nthe last three\nepisodes were titles\n\"Thanks to Them\", \"For\nthe Future\", and\n\"Watching and\nDreaming\", which the\nfirst words spell out\n\"Thanks for watching\"\n\n\n\n\n",
        "The show ends in a\nfantastic way, holding\nitself as one of my\nfavorite endings to a\nshow ever\n\nThey even had part\nof the ending tie into\na promised episode\nwhich never came\nwhere Luz had her\n\"King-ceera\"\n\n",
        "The Owl House is one\nof the things that\nhelped me through\nCOVID. The show was\nsomething to escape\ninto when the world\nhad gone to shit, and\nhaving LGBTQ+\nrepresentation really\nhelped me feel like I\nwas able to put myself\ninto the show\n\n",
        "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Drift King, if you see\nand read this. Ive\nloved your content\nfor years, and I\nsubscribed to the\nTwitch during the\nSoutheast Asia build\nso that I can be a\npart of the content\nthat Ive loved for so\nlong. I hope you have\na great day\nBest Wishes\nGoldenolaf20"
