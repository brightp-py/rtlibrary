        "The Norwegian Lady\nstands on the\nboardwalk overlooking\nthe Atlantic Ocean in\nVirginia Beach, VA, and\nher twin sister stands\non the beach in Moss,\nNorway as a memorial\nof a tragic shipwreck\nin the year 1891, and\nat the same time as a\nsymbol of the\nfriendship between\nthe two sister cities.",
        "The bark Dictator,\nregistered in Moss, in\nMarch 1891 was on\nthe way from\nPensacola, Florida, to\nEngland with a cargo\nof lumber. Her master,\nCaptain Jrgensen,\nhad a crew of 14\naboard, and also his\nwife and their\nfour-year-old son.\n\n",
        "Rounding the south\ncoast of Florida the\nDictator ran into a\nstorm which increased\nto a hurricane off the\nBahamas. The high\nwaves smashed two of\nher lifeboats and\nswept them overboard.\nThe vessel sprang a\nleak, the pumps were\nbroken, and water was\nflowing in.\n",
        "Captain Jrgensen\nthen decided to pull\ninto Hampton Roads\nfor repair.\nThe weather had made\nit impossible to\nascertain the position\nfor several days, and\nsuddenly, when\napproaching the\ncoast, the bark hit a\nsandbar about 350\nyards from the\nVirginia Beach shore.",
        "The day after the\nshipwreck the\nmagnificent figurehead\nof the Dictator was\nfound among the\nwreckage. It was\nplaced on the\noceanfront, facing the\nsea, as a memorial to\nthe shipwreck and\nthose who perished. It\nstood for 62 years,\nuntil it was destroyed\nby hurricane Barbara.",
        "The people of Virginia\nBeach did not forget\ntheir Norwegian Lady,\nand after some time\nthe possibility of a\nreplacement of the\nfigurehead was\ndiscussed.Erik Bye,\nwell known from\npopular seamen's\nprograms in the\nNorwegian\nBroadcasting\nCorporation",
        "took interest in the\nstory. In cooperation\nwith Emil Andersen,\nMayor of Moss, the\nnecessary money was\nraised from shipping\nand industrial\ncompanies in Moss for\na memorial at Virginia\nBeach, a figurehead in\nbronze. The Norwegian\nsculptor rnulf Bast\nwas commissioned for\nthe work.",
        "The Jubilee Fund of\n1920 for the\nBeautifying of Moss\nCity'' and The Society\nfor the Welfare of the\nCity of Moss'' donated\na duplicate of the\nsculpture to the city\nof Moss, and on\nSeptember 22, 1962,\nthe unveiling could\ntake place in Virginia\nBeach and in Moss\nsimultaneously.",
        "In April 1991, the\nLady in Moss, Norway\nwas removed from its\noriginal place by the\nTown Hall Bridge to\nthe park by the Canal,\nwhere she now stands\nfacing the sea and\ngreeting her sister in\nVirginia Beach, Virginia.\n\n\n\n",
        "The Norwegian Lady\nstatue became a solid\nbond between Virginia\nBeach and Moss.\nEvery year since\n1962, at the time of\nthe anniversary of\nthe shipwreck Dictator\na memorial service\ntakes place at the\nNorwegian Lady in\nVirginia Beach, and\nflowers are placed by\nthe statue.",
        "In 1974, the Virginia\nBeach City Council\nadopted a resolution\nofficially extending an\ninvitation to Moss to\nbecome a sister city\nfor the purpose of\ncreating greater\nmutual understanding\nbetween the people of\nMoss and Virginia\nBeach.\n\n"
