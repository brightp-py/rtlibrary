        "The Scotiabank\nSaddledome.\n\nBuilt in 1983 in\nanticipation for the\n1988 Olympics, it is\none of the main event\nplaces in Calgary.\nHome of the Calgary\nFlames, it is used for\nNHL, WHL, and NLL\nevents, alongside\npresenters and\npreformers.",
        "Sized at 474,000 sq ft,\nand with a capacity of\n19,289, it has been\naround for 30 years\nnow.\n\nIt hasn't gone without\nit's trouble though. In\n2013, Calgary flooded,\nand the Saddledome\nwas damaged. Water\nflooded up to the\neight row of seats,\ncausing major damage.",
        "However, Calgarians\nare dedicated people.\nOnce the flood waters\nreceeded, work began\nquickly, and it was\nback in action only 2\nMONTHS later.\n\nEvery evening, the\nSaddledome roof,\nshapped like a saddle\nhense its name, lights\nup red in the city\nskyline.",
        "It is set to be\nreplaced soon\nhowever. In 2019 a\nnew proposal for an\nEvent Centre was\napproved by council,\nand is set to replace\nthe Saddledome.\nConstruction will begin\nin 2021, and the\nSaddledome will be\ndemolished after the\nnew arena opens.\n",
        "But despite this\nlooming end date, it\nhas served as one\nkey landmark for our\ncity, and the C of Red\nwill continue to live on\neven when it's gone.\n\nGO FLAMES GO!\n\n\n\n\n"
