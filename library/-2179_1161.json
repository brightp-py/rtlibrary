        "Vermont History\n\nVermont is the 14th\nstate. This is because,\nwhile it was colonized\naround the same time\nas the other states,\nNew York,\nMassachusetts, and\nNew Hampshire all\nconsidered it part of\ntheir territory. New\nHampshire begain\nselling land in Vermont",
        "between 1749 and\n1764. Naturally, New\nYork got upset, and\nbegan demanding\nVermont colonists pay\nthem for the land they\nhad already paid for.\nEven more naturally,\nthe Vermonters were\nupset, especially\nEthan Allen, who\nco-owned the Onion\nRiver Land company.\n",
        "Long story short,\nThey formed the\ngreen mountian boys,\na terrorist group.\nThey hated New york,\nand declared Vermont\nan independant\nrepubic.\n\nSo, when the American\nRevolution started,\ncongress saw a\nfighting force in\nVermont and recruited",
        "them. Ethan Allen and\nthe others captured\nFort Ticonderoga in\nNew York shortly\nafter before they had\neven heard war was\non.\n\nEthan Allen then tried\nto go capture\nMontreal and got\ninstantly captured,\nspending the majority\nof the rest of his",
        "life on a British\nvessel as a prisoner.\nHe was eventually\nreleased, moving to\nBurlington, Vermont,\nwhere he died after...\nWell, after crossing a\nfrozen lake while\ndrunk (this is debated\nbut likely true).\n\nAs someone who works\nat a museum dedicated\nto Ethan, he was a",
        "pretty bad person\nand writer.\n\nNonetheless, Vermont\neventually became a\nstate by threatening\nto join Britain, and\nwas let in as a trade\nfor Kentucky. We've\nsorta been forgotten\never since, but not\nenough people know\nour history! I am an\n18th-century",
        "reenactor and love to\nshare this stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Fun facts about\nVermont:\n\n1. We don't have soft\nserve. We call them\n\"Creemees\", which are\nsimular, but tend to be\nsmoother and are\namazing. I really\nconfused a resturnat\nin Maine once due to\nthat. Also Maple, maple\neverywhere. We will\nliterally die without it.",
        "2. Vermont, like all\nstates, has multiple\nindigious populations\nwho were oppressed\nand had terrible\nthings done to them. I\nwish I knew more\nabout their history-\nit's really facinating\nto see demonstations\nand interacive\ndisplays that our\nlocal organization\ndoes.",
        "3. Ben and Jerry's ice\ncream originates in\nVermont, and their\nfactory here holds\nawesome tours.\nThere's a local debate\nover whether they\nactually may have\nstolen the recipe from\na local collage's ice\ncream, but I'll leave it\nup to you to decide.\n\n",
        "4. Skiing and\nSnowboarding is huge\nin Vermont. Burton, the\ncompany, also\noriginates from here.\nI have never\nsnowboarded, and\nhave only skiied once,\nwhich is quite unusual\nover here.\n\n\n\n",
        "5. Vermont has two\nvery unique terms:\n\n\"Vermonter\" is highly\ndebated and tends to\nonly refer to people\nwho were born in the\nstate and lived their a\nwhile. But some say it's\nabout generations\nlived there.\n\n\"Flatlander\" refers to\nout-of-staters.",
        "6. We have so many\nfarms. The smell of\ncow manure is a\nchildhood memory to\nme. Really, the closer\nyou get to Burlington\n(Which many people\nthink is the capital but\nisn't), the more modern\nit is. Everything else\nis, again, mostly farms\nand hunting cabins.\nStowe and Middlebury\nare two exceptions.",
        "7. The development of\nVermont is very\nstrange. You can be in\nbackcountry fields\none second, and a\npolished, nationally\nrecognized collage\nthe next. We also have\na strong movement\nfor green energy! We\nlove our forests and\nsome energy\ncompanies have gone\ncarbon-neutral.",
        "8. Vermont is pretty\nexpensive to live in,\nbut our politicans\nhave been trying to\nsolve that problem.\nShoutout to Taylor\nSmall, a close friend's\nrelative and one of\nten open Trans\nlegislators in the U.S.!\n\n\n\n",
        "9. We have the world's\ntallest filing cabnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's about as cool as\nit sounds.",
        "10. Our state flower is\nthe red clover, and\nour ecosystem is\nbasically one big lake\nthen mountians all\naround.\n\nVer = Green\nMont = Mountian\n\n11. Our state capital\nis the only in the U.S.\nwithout a McDonalds. It\nalso floods alot.",
        "As soon as RT read\nmy superchat about\nmy home of VT being\nconsumed by New New\nYork I knew I had to\nbuild a small thing to\nrepresent it. I hope\nyou enjoyed reading\nabout our brave little\nstate!\n\n\n\n",
        "RT, I wanna let you\nknow, you're now a\npart of my summer\ncamp's inside jokes,\nminecraft server, and\ninteractions. You are\nmy favorite streamer\nby far, and please\nkeep doing what\nyou're doing.\nIf you're reading this,\ncan you please say\n\"Damn Friday I'll Sue\"\nfor my friends?",
        "Wow this is a long\nbook.\n\nHope no-one from\nChile is offended for\ntaking this little spot\nto share about my\nhomeland taken over\nby New New York.\n\n\n\n\n"
