This is\nthe Macha Maple Man\nor the MMM for short,\nthis is a Macha used\nonly on New Year's\nDay to steal and\nstore heat from the\nEarth for houses and\nother buildings. It is\nalso rentable for\npeople who might need\nit on New Year's Day.",
        "People who do rent it\nwill be consided\nselfish and be banned\nfrom canada after\nthey finish using it or\nuntil the battery runs\nout. And yes it does\nrun on batteries,\nspecial batteries made\nby the government.\n\n\n\n",

        "Editor's Note:\nThe right book has\nbeen added\nto this one.",
        "Long long ago, three\nmen were out in the\ncold bizzard night.\nOne of the men named\nNotch, said \"You know\nI'm getting tired of\nbeing out here in the\nfreezing cold. How\ncome Americans\nalready have heat\nand it's the year\n1560.\"\n\n",
        "The other two men\nagreed. So they\ndesided to travel all\nthe way to America. It\ntook them 9 months\nsince they had to walk\nby foot. And when\nthey asked America\nthey simply said \"No\"\nSo the three men\ndesided to build a\nMechine that would\nproduce heat.\n",
        "But it was easier said\nthan done, so they\nsaid instead of\nproducing heat, it will\nsteal heat and store\nit. So they went to\nwork constructing the\nMechine until it was\nfinished. And after it\nwas finished, they\ndesided to test it out.\n\n\n",
        "But sadly for the men\nit had a flaw, when\ndetecting heat it\nfound one of the\nmen's heat signiture\nand sucked them up\nand they were never\nseen again until 2020.\nBut that's a story for\nanother time.\n\n\n\n",
        "Back to the current\nstory after the man\nwas sucked up the\nother two men desided\nto remake the Mecha\nbut were they could\npilot it and their\nworthy desendents.\n\nAnd that's the Lore\nbehind the Mecha\nMaple Man or the MMM\nfor short.\n"
