        "Megalania is an extinct\nspecies of giant\nmonitor lizard, part of\nthe megafauna that\nonce roamed Australia\nduring the\nPleistocene. It is the\nlargest terrestrial\nlizard known to have\nexisted, with estimate\nputting it at a length\nof 3.5 to 7 metres.\nHowever, due to\nfragmentary remains,",
        "these estimate are\nhighly uncertain. The\nyoungest known fossil\nof Megalania dates\nback to around 50,000\nyears ago, which\nwould've put them in\ncontact with the first\nindigenous settlers of\nAustralia. Naturally,\nhumans could have\nbeen a factor in their\nextinction.\n",
