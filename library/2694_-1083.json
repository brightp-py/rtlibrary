        "In Calamity, Adult\nEidolon Wyrms spawn\nwhen you try to enter\nthe Abyss biome with\nthe chaos state\ndebuff (given by the\nrod of discord.) Pre\n1.5, they had max\ndamage resistance, so\ncoldheart icicle\ncheese (a weapon that\nalways does 2% of the\ntarget's health on hit)\nwas meta.",

        "Pre-1.5, there was a\nglitch where after\ngetting killed by an\nAEW, it would follow\nyou to your\nspawnpoint and\npeacefully hover\nthere. It wouldn't hurt\nyou until you hurt it. A\nstreamer named an\nAEW born from this\nglitch Jared, and\nthat's been his name\never since.",
        "However, when AEWs\nwere reworked in 1.5,\nthis glitch was\npatched. Now I imagine\nhim being happy on\nvacation.\n\nR.I.P Jared\n2019-2021\nCalamity won't be the\nsame without you\n\n(2019 was when Jared\nspecifically was born)"
