        "Hello, Xissel here. Not\na Chilote myself, but I\nlove this myth so much\nI had to build it.\n\nThis is El Caleuche, a\nlegendary ghost ship\nthat can go below the\nsurface and carries\nthe souls of drowned\nsailors. The bit I like\nis that the boat is\nalways lit up and all\nthe dead sailors get",
        "to spend their time\npartying on board !\nIt's a fairly wholesome\nending to a grim start.\n\nThe drowned men are\nbrought onto the\nCaleuche by three\nmerpeople from\nChilote mythology : the\nsirena chilota, the\npincoya and the\npincoy, all siblings.\n",
        "The only living people\nallowed on board are\na type of Chilote\nsorcerers known as\nbrujos, who travel\nthere by mounting\nseahorses (yes,\nreally).\n\nObviously the legends\nsurrounding El\nCaleuche are not all\nfun and games, since\nit's about dead people.",
        "Hopefully I've not\nmade mistakes or\nmisrepresented the\nlocal culture, and I\ninvite anyone who\nknows better than me\nto add and correct\nthis book.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
