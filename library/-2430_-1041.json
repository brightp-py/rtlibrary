        "construction. The\nchurch was eventually\ncompleted, and\nGuastavino's tomb was\nplaced inside of the\nBasilica, where it\nremains to this day.\nThe Basilica is\ncredited to have the\nlargest freestanding\novular dome in North\nAmerica.\n\n",
        "This church is\ngenuinely beautiful\nIRL and I really hope i\ndid it some bit of\njustice with this\nrecreation.\nThe scale is a bit off,\nI don't know exactly\nhow to make the armor\nstands appear like\nstatues, and I had to\nrecreate some of this\n\n",
        "purely from memory,\nsince I wasn't able to\nfind pictures of some\nparts and haven't\nbeen to the Basilica\nmuch due to, well,\ny'know.\nAlthough it has issues,\nthe fact of the matter\nis I tried and I hope\nthat you may have\nlearned something\nabout the Basilica\nfrom this recreation.",
        "Built completely by:\nNodnarb8\n\n\n\nP.S. I also built the\n7-Eleven down in\nFlorida.\nAlso I probably missed\nsome stuff in the\nbuild, but oh well.\n\n\n"
