        "This is the sword\nwielded by Damien, The\nHigh Priest of\nRegidrago, during the\nfirst Ice-Dragon War.\nKnown as The Iscariot,\nor The Sword of\nBetrayal, this sword\nwas responsible for\nthe death of Nuyural,\nthe Ice Dragon,\nbreaking the truce\nbetween the cults of\nIce and Drago.",
        "This unprovoked\nmurder of the Ice\nDragon caused Grima,\nDamien's sister and\nthe High Priest of\nRegice, to meet him in\nsingle combat on the\nIsland of Marbustal,\nwhich would later be\nnamed New Australia.\n\n\n\n",
        "This battle lasted for\nten days, the\ncollateral damage\nfrom their fight\nturning Marbustal into\nthe desolate,\nhorrifying place it is\ntoday. To end the\nfight, Grima was\nforced to kill her\nbrother by freezing\nhis blood.\n\n",
        "Damien's sword still\nrests in the place\nwhere he died,\nembedded in a piece\nof Grima's shield.\nThough the war would\nend five years after\ntheir duel, Grima still\nharbors resentment\ntowards the Cult of\nRegidrago, a sentiment\nthat is shared by\nVesperon, the New\nPriest of Regidrago."
