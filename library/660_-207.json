        "\n      INTRODUCTION\n\nThis building is what I\nenvision what the\nimperial palace of the\nformer Central\nAfrican Empire could\nhave looked like. No,\nthis is not a model of\nan actual building, I\ntook inspiration from\nthe Capitol Building in\nWashington DC.",
        "\n      Foundations\n\nIn 1976, the Central\nAfrican Republic was\nproclaimed as an\nabsolute monarchy by\nits military dictator,\nMarshal Jean-Bedel\nBokassa. This gave\nbirth to the Central\nAfrican Empire. The\ncountry spent $20\nmillion USD on his",
        "coronation alone,\nwhich accounted to\none third of the\nentire country's\nnational income.\n\nHis lavish coronation\nmirrored that of\nNapoleon I of France,\nwhere Bokossa\ncrowned himself and\ndeclared his title to\nbe \"His Imperial\nMajesty,\" ruling on",
        "behalf of the Central\nAfrican People.\nBokossa justified his\nactions by stating a\nmonarchy would\ndistinguish the\ncountry from the rest\nof the continent, and\ngain the respect of\nforeign nations.\nDespite sending\ninvitations, no foreign\nleader attended the\ncoronation.",
        "Bokossa declared that\nthe republic would be\na constitutional\nmonarchy, however,\nthe structure of\ngovernment and\nBokossa's dictatorial\npowers remained, thus\nlikening the country to\nan absolute monarchy.\n\n\n\n",
        "\nThe End of the Empire\n\nDespite the grandoise\njustifications and\nspending of Bokossa,\nhis reign would only\nlast by two more\nyears. Government\nbrutality towards\nprotesters soured\nrelations with France,\nthe country's former\ncolonial overlord.",
        "Operation Baracuda,\nwhich is described to\nbe \"France's last\ncolonial expedition,\"\nthe French conducted\na coup of the\ngovernment, allowing\nthe previous\npresident, David\nDacko, to take control\nwhile Bakossa was\naway in Libya. On the\n20th of September,\n1979, the French",
        "kicked off Operation\nBaracuda, where\nparachute infantry\nlanded in the country\nand secured Bangui\nM'Poko International\nAirport, allowing more\nsupport to fly into the\ncountry from\nneighbouring Chad. By\nnoon of the next day,\nDacko proclaimed the\nend of the Central\nAfrican Empire.",
        "Bakossa would die in\nthe country in 1993.\n\nDacko would be\noverthrown by\nGeneral Andre\nKolingba in 1981.\n\nThe Central African\nRepublic is currently\nin an ongoing civil war.\n\n\n"
